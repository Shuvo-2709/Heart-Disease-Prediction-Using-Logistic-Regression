# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

# Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using **Logistic Regression**, a supervised machine learning algorithm.  
The model is trained on a structured medical dataset containing attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and more.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

# Dataset
The dataset includes patient health parameters such as:

- Age  
- Gender 
- Chest Pain Type  
- Resting Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol  
- Fasting Blood Sugar  
- Resting ECG  
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved  
- Exercise Induced Angina  
- Number of Major Vessels  
- Thalassemia  
- Target (Heart Disease: 1 = Yes, 0 = No)

# Approach

# 1. Data Loading  
Loaded dataset using Pandas and checked for missing values.

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Statistical summary  
- Graphical visualization  
- Correlation analysis  

# 3. Data Preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables   
- Train-test split  

# 4. Model Building  
Used **Logistic Regression** from Scikit-learn.

# 5. Model Evaluation  
- Accuracy Score 

---

# Results
The Logistic Regression model gives a good baseline for predicting heart disease.  
Final accuracy and metrics are shown inside the notebook.
